hooks do not work in:-
1. function other than react function components
2. top-level if statement

hooks work only in the top-level of react function component 

useTransition:-
give high priority and low priority to states 
hight priority states render first and low priority states which need more time to compute render after than high priority states


useDeferredValue:-
kinda like useTransition but here we don't always have to set state it's just for deferring value (Debounce And Throttle)

useLayoutEffect:-
the only and main difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect is useLayoutEffect is always sync but useEffect is not
